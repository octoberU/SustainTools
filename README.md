# SustainTools
Audica utility tool for creating sustain audio using existing .audica files.

##Usage
* Download [the latest release](https://github.com/octoberU/SustainTools/releases/tag/0.1.0)
* Drag `.audica` files onto `SustainTools.exe`
* The tool will export a new audica file with the same name as your old one + `_s`

I recommend tweaking sustain volumes in the moggsongs to suit your taste.
